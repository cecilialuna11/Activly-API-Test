# Simple React.js API Excerise

**The Goal**

Use this repo as a starting point to create a simple and dynamic React project.

There are no guidelines other than to display at least 10 'Cat Facts' from the given API. All styling and formatting is up to you! Be as creative as you'd like!

**Navigating the File**

I've already created a file to house your API function: src -> Util -> ContentAPI.js

All of the content will be displayed in the Content.js file: src -> Pages -> Content.js

Styling will be done in the index.css file: src -> index.css

I've also created a components file incase you decide to create some components: src -> Components

*(Feel free to restructure any files as you'd like!)*

**API Info**

The api endpoint we'll be using is: https://cat-fact.herokuapp.com/facts/random?amount=10. (this will just spit out 10 random cat facts)

Here are the API docs: https://alexwohlbruck.github.io/cat-facts/docs/endpoints/facts.html

Also, if you want you can use this API to generate random cat photos (not required): https://docs.thecatapi.com/

**Any Questions?**

Feel free to reach out if you run into any issues, get stuck, or have any questions! qobond@gmail.com

Also, don't stress too much about perfecting the design. It does not need to be anywhere near perfect! This is just to get a feel for how you code/structure your code.
